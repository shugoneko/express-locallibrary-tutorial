A Tutorial we followed in Class:
**A link to the tutorial. (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs)**

**Description of the main learning objectives for this project**
* From my perspective the main learning objectives for this project were:
    * To learn how to run the back and front ends of a database sever website.
    * To know how to use Express/Node.
    * To use Javascript and Html scripts in conjunction.
    * Learned how to use MongoDB.

**Description of challenges that you ran into and the process of how you worked through the issue**
* My biggest challenges that I ran into were:
    * Usually not always understanding the prewritten code, so I would often rename varibles halfway through a code.
    * Most of my issues were found in the varible names, one time I put an 's' on the end of a variable and didn't spot it for an hour.
    * But the biggest challenge of them all is to know when to ask for help. I would often try to solve everything on my own without fresh eyes on my project.
    
    * My solitions for most of my problems was to either work through the issue without asking for help or realizing that I really needed help.

**Reflection on how you see this tutorial helping you approach future web projects.**
I believe that now that I have finished this tutorial if I ever need do a project like this again I will have a better understanding of what needs to be done. This is my second time through this course. To be completely honest the second time through was much easier. As I already understood much of the first half of the course. Though working with Herku is new but very useful to understand. I look forward to using Herku in the future.
